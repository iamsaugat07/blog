This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

Large Language Model have generated a shift in our daily life. We can already see impact of LLMs based appilcation like ChatGPT in our daily lifes. 

The fundamental working principle behind such LLMs has been deep learning. I am grateful enough to live in this period where we can leverage such powerful models to do anything that involves natural language.

And this is exciting as I begin to learn more about language models, machine learning, AI and whatever the heck that comes out in the future. I feel like this is the right time to get into machine learning and AI for anyone literally.
